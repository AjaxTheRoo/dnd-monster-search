# D&D 5e Monster Search

## User Story
As a D&D player, 
I want a visual guide to the monsters,
so that I can visualize the danger in front of me

## Description
This is a image search site for the various monsters in Dungeons & Dragons.
If you participate in D&D Campaigns, you may have had a situation like this.
The Dungeon Manster is describing the moster you are currently facing, but you don't know which one he is talking about.
All you have to do is search the name of the monster bering described, an you will have a better idea of the danger (or not) that stands before you.

## Technical 
The website uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
For the CSS portion, Tailwind CSS was used, this allows the majority of design components to be coded on the index page.
The only exception is the custom font for the header title, which had do be put in a seperate stylesheet.
